# New-Zealand-Housing-Market-Trends-and-Forecast
### **Business Task**
Analyse historical housing market data to identify key economic drivers and forecast future housing price trends to support urban planning, investment strategies, and policy development in New Zealand.
## Why This Theme
I chose the 'New Zealand Housing Market Trends and Forecast' theme because I was surprised by how high house prices are here compared to my home country, Japan. I also discovered that housing affordability and property prices are major social and economic concerns in New Zealand. I wanted to explore how data analysis and forecasting could help uncover trends, understand key drivers like population growth and investment, and support informed decision-making for individuals and policymakers. This project allowed me to apply time-series forecasting, data visualization, and scenario analysis to a highly relevant and impactful real-world issue.

- Population and migration data from Stats NZ
- Household Income Data from Reserve Bank of New Zealand
- Resional data from Figure NZ

### **Key Insights from the Dashboard**
- **Consistent Growth in HPI（House Price)**：The current Housing Price Index (HPI) shows a steady upward trend from 1990 to 2024, with an average annual growth rate of 19.54%. This suggests long-term market appreciation, despite short-term volatility driven by events such as COVID-19 and post-2021 inflation shocks.
- **Forecast to 2030**:　The forecast model (based on Random Forest Model) projects the HPI will reach approximately  3.51 by 2030, continuing the growth trajectory. This may signal a gradual slowdown in housing market growth, potentially due to affordability constraints, higher interest rates, or plateauing demand.
- **Investment vs Price**: There is a clear positive correlation between residential investment (as a share of GDP) and average HPI(house price).Regions with consistent public or private investment tend to experience stronger long-term growth in property values.
- **Regional Disparities**: Auckland consistently reports the highest average house prices, followed by Wellington and Christchurch. The North Island generally shows higher property prices than the South Island, likely driven by migration trends and infrastructure development.
- **Average HPI by Net migration and Net population**: Correlations between HPI and Net migration and population showed weak to moderate correlations.The data suggests that when net migration exceeds 59,800 and net population surpasses 99,400, HPI begins to show stronger positive correlations—indicating that above a certain threshold, population growth contributes meaningfully to housing demand and price increases.
- **2018–2019 Shift**: Comparing 2018 and 2019,  all regions except Auckland experienced the increase in average HPI, potentially linked to increased migration or housing shortages.Auckland’s slight decline in house prices from 2018 to 2019 may reflect a market correction after years of rapid growth, influenced by policy changes such as the foreign buyer ban and tightened lending rules. It highlights how external regulations and affordability pressures can momentarily ease housing demand, even in high-demand regions.
