# New-Zealand-Housing-Market-Trends-and-Forecast
### **Business Task**
Analyse historical housing market data to identify key economic drivers and forecast future housing price trends to support urban planning, investment strategies, and policy development in New Zealand.
## Why This Theme
I chose the 'New Zealand Housing Market Trends and Forecast' theme because I was surprised by how high house prices are here compared to my home country, Japan. I also discovered that housing affordability and property prices are major social and economic concerns in New Zealand. I wanted to explore how data analysis and forecasting could help uncover trends, understand key drivers like population growth and investment, and support informed decision-making for individuals and policymakers. This project allowed me to apply time-series forecasting, data visualization, and scenario analysis to a highly relevant and impactful real-world issue.
